# TensorFlow Custom Wheels
These wheels are built for use on LogicalSpark's linux builds, currently either Ubuntu 16.04 (Prod) or 16.10 (Dev), to make it easier for environments to be built. Feel free to use them for your own use.

Currently there are two flavours; a CPU-only build and GPU with Cuda 9 build.

The list of all custom wheels can be found in the  [releases page](https://github.com/LogicalSpark/wheels/releases).
